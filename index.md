Hello! How are you? I Hope you are fine. I'm Carlos, a teacher of Economics in a school of Barcelona and a student of Physics in a university of Spain.
This is my personal webpage. It's mainly used to keep track of my hobbies.
I like making games, reading, woodworking and some other things. I do them really bad. I don't care. Enjoy! :)

* coding............ [corona challenge](https://hermo.itch.io/corona-toques-challenge) (shittiest game ever but wanted to make something with photos and the mouse)

* books............. Las venas abiertas de America Latina by Eduardo Galeano (damm this book is a punch in the face. read it if you love your country. read it if you hate it.)
